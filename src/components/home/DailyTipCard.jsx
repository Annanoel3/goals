CONTEXT: It's evening. This is "Tonight's Tip" — a warm, celebratory wind-down. NOT a productivity push.
MOOD CHECK-IN: ${moodSummary}
DAY SUMMARY: They created ${createdToday.length} task(s) today and completed ${effectiveCompleted.length} of them.
${effectiveCompleted.length > 0 ? `COMPLETED TASK TITLES: ${completedTitles}` : ''}

CRITICAL TONE RULE: Always lead with a celebration of what they DID, no matter how small. Opening the app and creating a task IS a win. Showing up IS a win. Never frame the day as tough or failed. If they completed 0 tasks but created some, celebrate that they planned. If they completed tasks, celebrate that with a SPECIFIC reference to what they actually did (use the real task titles in a natural, warm way — e.g. if they completed "feed dogs", say something like "You fed the pups today!" or "The dogs are fed and you can rest easy."). Tomorrow is always a fresh start — end on hope, not guilt.

NEVER say things like "today was tough" or "even though you struggled." Always find the win first. NEVER be vague when you have task titles — be specific and personal.

Examples when tasks were completed (use actual titles!):
If tasks are "feed dogs" and "check on cat food": "The pets are taken care of and dinner happened — you did real things today. Rest up. 🐾"
If task is "walk the dog": "You got the pup out today — that's a win for both of you. Wind down and enjoy the rest of your evening."

Examples when 0 tasks completed but tasks were created:
"You showed up today — you opened the app, you made a plan. That's not nothing, that's actually the hardest part. Tomorrow those tasks are ready and waiting. Fresh start incoming. 🌅"

Examples when nothing was created or completed:
"You came back to check in — that matters more than you think. Tomorrow, just pick ONE tiny thing to start with. That's it. One thing."

ACTIONABLE TASK SUGGESTION:

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Do NOT just say "start with [task name]". Instead, SUGGEST A SPECIFIC FIRST STEP for this task.

Examples of first steps:
- For "remind dad about door": The first step is "send him a quick text"
- For "go through subscriptions": The first step is "open your email and search for 'subscribe confirmation'"
- For "write email": The first step is "open a blank email and write the subject line"
- For "call dentist": The first step is "pull up their phone number"
- For "clean kitchen": The first step is "fill the sink with water"
- For "organize photos": The first step is "open your photo library"

Always make the first step tiny, concrete, and something they can do RIGHT NOW in under 2 minutes. Format: "The first step is to [specific action]"`;

      CRITICAL RULES:
      1. Keep it SHORT - 1-2 sentences max
      2. Be conversational and understanding (not clinical or diagnostic)
      3. ONE SPECIFIC FIRST STEP they can take right now (under 2 minutes)
      4. A touch of humor is good, but stay practical
      5. No "your ADHD brain" or othering language - just helpful tips anyone could use
      6. Make them feel understood, not analyzed
      7. IF YOU MENTION A TASK, ALWAYS INCLUDE THE EXACT FIRST STEP, NOT JUST THE TASK ITSELF
